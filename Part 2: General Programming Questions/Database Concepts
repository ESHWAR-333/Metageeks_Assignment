**Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. Provide examples of use cases for each.**

**SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:**

* SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.
* They have a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the data (tables, columns, relationships) is defined before inserting data.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle.


**NoSQL Databases:**

* NoSQL databases are non-relational and provide a flexible schema. They can store and process large amounts of unstructured data.
* They are suitable for large-scale distributed data and real-time applications.
* Examples: MongoDB (document store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store).


**Use Cases:**

**SQL**: Suitable for applications where data structure is fixed and the relationship between entities is well-defined, such as traditional business applications.
**NoSQL**: Ideal for scenarios with dynamic and evolving data structures, like social media, big data analytics, and real-time applications.
