
**Discuss three coding best practices that you consider important for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.**

1. Code Readability:

Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and provide comments when necessary.
Follow a consistent coding style throughout the project. This helps in collaboration and maintenance.

2. Modularity and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):

Break down code into smaller, modular functions or classes. Each function/class should have a single responsibility.
Avoid duplicating code. Instead, encapsulate reusable logic into functions or modules to promote maintainability.

3. Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling to anticipate and gracefully handle unexpected situations.
Use try-except blocks for exception handling. Provide informative error messages that aid debugging.
Logging errors can assist in identifying and fixing issues in production environments.
