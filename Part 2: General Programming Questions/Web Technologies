What is CORS, and how does it work? How can you handle CORS-related issues in a web application?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**

->CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources hosted in another domain.
->It is designed to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. CORS works by including HTTP headers that specify which origins are permitted to access a resource.


**Handling CORS Issues:**

->Enable CORS on the server by adding the appropriate headers to responses.
->In a web application, use techniques such as JSONP, server-side proxies, or configure the server to allow specific origins.
->For development, tools like CORS browser extensions can be used to temporarily disable CORS restrictions.
